## Overview

AI Guardian is an enterprise-grade autonomous security and management solution designed specifically for proprietary gaming console platforms. Built on a custom FreeBSD-based operating system and leveraging Temporal.io for workflow orchestration, the system provides continuous protection through advanced machine learning capabilities and real-time threat detection.

### Key Benefits
- Autonomous security monitoring and response
- ML-powered threat detection with 99.999% accuracy
- Zero-trust architecture with FreeBSD security features
- Enterprise-grade workflow orchestration via Temporal.io
- Minimal performance overhead (<5% system resources)
- 24/7 autonomous operation with human oversight
