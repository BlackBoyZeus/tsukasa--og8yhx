## Infrastructure Security Overview

### Security Architecture
The AI Guardian system implements a multi-layered security architecture:

- Kernel-level security through FreeBSD security features
- Hardware-backed security via TPM/HSM integration
- Network isolation and segmentation
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- End-to-end encryption for all data flows
- Real-time security monitoring and threat detection

### Security Components
Core security components include:

- FreeBSD Capsicum capability framework
- Mandatory Access Control (MAC) Framework
- GELI disk encryption
- ZFS encrypted storage
- TPM 2.0 integration
- Hardware Security Module (HSM)
- Network security stack
- Audit logging system

## Deployment Security

### FreeBSD Security
FreeBSD security features configuration:

#### Capsicum Configuration
```sh
# Enable Capsicum capability mode
security.capability_mode=2
security.capability.enabled=1
```

#### MAC Framework
```sh
# Enable MAC framework
security.mac.enabled=1
security.mac.mls.enabled=1
security.mac.biba.enabled=1
```

#### GELI Encryption
```sh
# GELI encryption configuration
geli_init_flags="aalgo=aes-xts-256 ealgo=aes-cbc-256"
```

### Hardware Security

#### TPM Integration
- Secure boot chain validation
- Platform attestation
- Key sealing and unsealing
- PCR measurements

#### HSM Configuration
- AES-256 key generation and storage
- RSA-4096 signing operations
- PKCS#11 interface
- High-availability configuration

### Network Security

#### Network Isolation
```sh
# Network security configuration
pf_enable="YES"
gateway_enable="NO"
ipfw_enable="YES"
```

#### Firewall Rules
```sh
# Base firewall configuration
pass in quick on $internal_if from $trusted_networks to any
block in all
block out all
pass out quick on $external_if proto tcp from any to any port $allowed_ports
```

## Access Control

### RBAC Implementation
Role-based access control matrix:

| Role | System Access | Network Access | Data Access |
|------|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| Administrator | Full | Full | Full |
| Security Engineer | Limited | Limited | Read-only |
| Operator | Minimal | None | None |

### Authentication
Multi-factor authentication requirements:

1. X.509 Certificate Authentication
2. TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)
3. Hardware Security Key
4. Biometric Authentication (where available)

## Data Protection

### Encryption Standards
- Data at Rest: AES-256-GCM
- Data in Transit: TLS 1.3
- Key Storage: HSM-backed
- Memory Protection: Secure enclaves

### Secure Storage Configuration
ZFS encryption setup:

```sh
# Create encrypted ZFS dataset
zfs create -o encryption=aes-256-gcm \
           -o keylocation=prompt \
           -o keyformat=passphrase \
           zroot/secure_data
```

## Monitoring and Auditing

### Security Monitoring
Real-time security monitoring configuration:

```yaml
monitoring:
  intervals:
    system_scan: 300  # 5 minutes
    network_scan: 60  # 1 minute
    integrity_check: 3600  # 1 hour
  
  alerts:
    critical:
      notification: immediate
      escalation: security_team
    warning:
      notification: daily_digest
      escalation: system_admin
```

### Audit Logging
Audit log configuration:

```yaml
audit:
  retention: 365  # days
  compression: true
  encryption: true
  
  events:
    - system_access
    - configuration_changes
    - security_alerts
    - authentication_attempts
```

## Compliance

### Compliance Requirements
Infrastructure must maintain compliance with:

1. Gaming Industry Security Standards
2. Data Protection Regulations
3. System Integrity Requirements
4. Audit Trail Maintenance

### Audit Procedures
Regular audit schedule:

| Audit Type | Frequency | Duration | Documentation |
|------------|-----------|----------|---------------|
| Security Scan | Daily | 1 hour | Automated Report |
| Configuration Review | Weekly | 4 hours | Manual Review |
| Penetration Test | Quarterly | 1 week | Detailed Report |
| Compliance Audit | Annually | 2 weeks | Certification |

## Security Incident Response

### Incident Classification
| Severity | Response Time | Escalation Path |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Critical | 15 minutes | Security Team + Management |
| High | 1 hour | Security Team |
| Medium | 4 hours | System Administrator |
| Low | 24 hours | Regular Queue |

### Response Procedures
1. Incident Detection
2. Initial Assessment
3. Containment
4. Investigation
5. Remediation
6. Recovery
7. Post-Incident Analysis

## Document Control
