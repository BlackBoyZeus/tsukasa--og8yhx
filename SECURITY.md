# Security Policy

## System Security Architecture

The AI Guardian system implements a comprehensive security architecture leveraging:

- FreeBSD security stack with Capsicum capability-based security
- Hardware-backed security using TPM and HSM integration
- ML-based threat detection and response
- Temporal.io workflow orchestration for security operations
- ZFS encrypted storage with GELI integration

### Security Objectives

1. Protect gaming console integrity and user data
2. Prevent unauthorized system access and modifications
3. Detect and respond to security threats in real-time
4. Ensure secure updates and system maintenance
5. Maintain audit trails for security operations

### Compliance Requirements

- RBAC-based access control enforcement
- Encrypted data storage and transmission
- Continuous security monitoring and logging
- Regular security assessments and updates
- Incident response and recovery procedures

### Security Controls Implementation

| Control Type | Implementation | Verification |
|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| Access Control | RBAC + MAC | Continuous audit |
| Network Security | Firewall + IDS | Real-time monitoring |
| Memory Protection | Rust safety + ASLR | Static analysis |
| Secure Boot | TPM + Measured Boot | Boot attestation |
| Runtime Protection | Temporal.io isolation | Container security |
