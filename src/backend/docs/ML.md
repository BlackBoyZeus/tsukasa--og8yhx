# Machine Learning System Documentation

## 1. Overview

The AI Guardian system's Machine Learning (ML) component provides real-time threat detection and autonomous security response capabilities through a production-grade ML pipeline built with Rust. The system leverages Burn (v0.8) for model training and Candle (v0.3) for optimized inference.
