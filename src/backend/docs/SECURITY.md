## Security Architecture Overview

The AI Guardian system implements a defense-in-depth security architecture leveraging FreeBSD's robust security features, hardware security modules (HSM), and a secure boot chain.

### Core Security Components
- FreeBSD Capsicum capability framework
- TPM 2.0 integration for secure boot
- Hardware Security Module (HSM) for key management
- ZFS encrypted storage with GELI
- Mandatory Access Control (MAC) framework
- Rust memory-safe implementation

### Security Boundaries

    F[TPM 2.0] --> B
    G[HSM] --> D
    H[GELI] --> E
```

## Authentication and Authorization

### Authentication Methods

#### X.509 Certificate Authentication
- Implementation: mTLS with OCSP stapling
- Key size: 4096-bit RSA
- Certificate lifetime: 1 year
- Rotation schedule: 90 days before expiry

#### Multi-Factor Authentication
- Primary: X.509 certificates
- Secondary: TOTP (RFC 6238)
- Tertiary: Hardware security token
- Session management: 15-minute timeout

#### API Key Management
- Format: JWT with EdDSA signatures
- Rotation: Every 30 days
- Revocation: Real-time via Redis blacklist
- Scope: Limited by RBAC policy

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

| Role | Access Level | Permissions |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| System Admin | Root | Full system access |
| Security Engineer | System | Security operations |
| Operator | Limited | Monitoring only |
| Auditor | Read-only | Audit log access |

## Cryptographic Implementation

### Encryption Standards

#### Data at Rest
- Algorithm: AES-256-GCM
- Key management: HSM-backed
- Storage: ZFS with GELI
- Key rotation: 90 days

#### Data in Transit
- Protocol: TLS 1.3
- Cipher suites:
  - TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
  - TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
- Perfect Forward Secrecy required
- OCSP stapling enabled

#### Key Hierarchy

    E[Master Key HSM] --> F[Data Encryption Keys]
    F --> G[Volume Keys]
    F --> H[Object Keys]
```

## Threat Detection and Response

### ML-Based Threat Detection
- Real-time anomaly detection
- Behavioral analysis
- Pattern recognition
- Threat classification

### Response Times

| Threat Level | Response Time | Actions |
|--------------|---------------|----------|
| Critical | < 100ms | System isolation, immediate mitigation |
| High | < 500ms | Automated response, alert escalation |
| Medium | < 1s | Enhanced monitoring, risk assessment |

### Automated Response Workflows

    Detection->>Analysis: Threat Detected
    Analysis->>Analysis: Classify Threat
    Analysis->>Response: Execute Action
    Response->>Recovery: Initiate Recovery
    Recovery->>Detection: System Restored
```

## Data Protection

### Data Classification

| Level | Protection | Storage | Access |
|-------|------------|---------|--------|
| Critical | AES-256-GCM + HSM | Encrypted ZFS | MFA + Audit |
| Sensitive | AES-256-GCM | Encrypted ZFS | RBAC + Audit |
| Internal | AES-256-GCM | Standard ZFS | RBAC |
| Public | None | Standard ZFS | Public |

### Memory Protection
- Rust memory safety guarantees
- ASLR enabled
- Stack canaries
- W^X memory policy
- Secure memory wiping

## Security Monitoring

### Real-Time Monitoring
- System integrity checking
- Network traffic analysis
- Resource usage monitoring
- Behavioral analysis
- Performance impact tracking

### Alert Generation
```mermaid

    A[Event Detection] --> B{Severity Check}
    B -->|Critical| C[Immediate Alert]
    B -->|High| D[Priority Alert]
    B -->|Medium| E[Standard Alert]
    
    C --> F[Auto Response]
    D --> G[Manual Review]
    E --> H[Monitoring]
```

## Incident Response

### Response Procedures

1. Detection Phase
